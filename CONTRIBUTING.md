# Contributing to the C++ Tour

The C++ Tour is a collaborative effort to provide an easy way of learning
the C++ language, through interactive lessons.

We encourage the following contributions:

- Creating new lessons
- Fixing bugs in existing lessons
- Proposing new lessons or changes to current lessons


# Pull Requests

We welcome contributions through pull requests for minor changes, like typos,
bug fixes in example code etc. Any large change should be first discussed in an
issue, and should be assigned to the pull request. This will increase the chances
that your pull request is accepted.


# Code Style

The project uses `clang-format` to produce a reproducible and consistent style
throughout all lessons. Please make sure to format all your code with the supplied
`.clang-format` before submitting any changes.


# Contributor License Agreement

By contributing to the C++ Tour (for example, through submitting a pull request)
you agree with the [individual contributor license agreement]. Make sure to read
and understand it.
